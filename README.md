# PhD-Programmes

This repository contains the STATA do-files for two of the three chapters of my PhD thesis.

The first do-file, peru_summary.do is for the first chapter, "Identifying the Role of Nutrition in Developing Cognitive Skill in Young Peruvian Children". The first half of the file is data prep, but using the data file peycall.dta can run the analysis. The original data files are available through the UK Data Service. See www.younglives.org.uk for more information. 

The second and third do-files, Paper3sibs.do and Paper3SD.do, are the data prep and analysis for the second chapter of my thesis, "The importance of family and friends on human capital development in the mid-childhood and early adolesence". The data file, p3sibs.dta, can be used to run the analysis. Other data files can be found through the UK Data Service. See www.younglives.org.uk for more information. 

Lastly, this repositiory includes two codes for recreating the Lewbel (2012) Instrumental Variable Procedure. The first is a montecarlo simulation and the second is a code creating confidence intervals using data. The data is available in the repository.
